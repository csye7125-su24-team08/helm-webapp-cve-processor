# Helm Webapp CVE Processor

This repository contains the Helm chart for the Webapp CVE Processor.

## Introduction to Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage and deploy applications. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications using simple templates called charts.

## Running the Template

To run the template, use the following command:

```shell
helm template <chart-name> <path-to-chart>
```

Replace `<chart-name>` with the desired name for your chart and `<path-to-chart>` with the path to your chart directory.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart, use the following command:

```shell
helm install <release-name> <path-to-chart>
```

Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for your release and `<path-to-chart>` with the path to your chart directory.

## Upgrading the Chart

To upgrade the chart, use the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade <release-name> <path-to-chart>
```

Replace `<release-name>` with the name of the release you want to upgrade and `<path-to-chart>` with the path to your updated chart directory.

## Updating Secret Values
To update the secret values for your chart, you can modify the values in the `values.yaml` file located in your chart directory. Open the `values.yaml` file and update the desired secret values according to your requirements.

## Creating a New Values File
To deploy the same chart with a different name, you can create a new values file. Copy the existing `values.yaml` file and rename it to `<new-values-file>.yaml`, where `<new-values-file>` is the desired name for your new values file. Open the new values file and update the necessary values, such as the release name, according to your requirements.

To deploy the chart with the new values file, use the following command:
```shell
helm install <release-name> <path-to-chart> -f <new-values-file>.yaml
```
Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for your release, `<path-to-chart>` with the path to your chart directory, and `<new-values-file>` with the name of your new values file.
